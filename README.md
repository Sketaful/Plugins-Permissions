# Plugins-Permissions
*Collecting different plugins permissions in an easy cut-and-paste list per plugin.

Using a lot of plugins means adding a lot of permissions. This would be quite fine if the permissions for plugins was easy to find and just copy in, but many times (most?) they're listed together with description, sometimes with the command used as well. Basically, you have to copy each permission one by one or copy it all into a notepad file and remove a lot of lines of text that's in the way.

This here is basically just a list of permissions for a bunch of plugins. A list easy to just copy/paste into your permissions plugin. I prefer, like many others, to use LuckPerms as my permissions manager. These lists are easy to copy/paste into LuckPerms web editor and then just go through them clicking true/false depending on what you want to allow. 

Sure. This might seem like a trivial thing, but with sometimes up to 70 different plugins on the server (or is that just me? :P) it takes forever to get it right. This just helps me, and I put it here to always have it within reach and perhaps help someone else.
